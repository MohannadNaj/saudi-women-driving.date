## WTH is this?
On 26-September-2017 [a supreme order was issued](http://www.spa.gov.sa/1671331) to allow women to drive in Saudi Arabia, Starting from 24-June-2018.

As a celebration of this news, in the next few hours after the announcement, I created this Countdown website and [tweeted it](https://twitter.com/MohannadNaj/status/912856925225832451).
